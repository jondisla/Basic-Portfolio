                Experience in front end developer for now, I have some experience with HTML and CSS for over a year and 3 months in Javascript.  I like to design the styling for sites for better user interaction.

            <p>
                I hold a technical diploma in web development with focus on programming from Valencia College. Currently I work at a private school setting up devices and maintaining the network servers.  Recently I took over as webmaster of the main school site.  I also work full time at Charter as tech support.  I would love to focus more on the design and developing side of technology.  I love the creative and design aspect of the web and find this career exciting and fulfilling.
